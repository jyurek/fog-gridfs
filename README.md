# fog-gridfs

This is an experimental gem written to prove to myself that fog can be extended
in such a way as to incorporate non-cloud technologies well. This gem in VERY
incomplete and not terribly well tested. It passes the specs and at least works
for me, so there's that.

## Use at your own risk.

It's a few hours' hacking and barely passes the minimal specs I've written for
it.

That said, if you think this is useful, by all means please fork, hack, and
give me pull requests. It would be awesome for this to one day be useful to
more people.
